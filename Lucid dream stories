    <h3>Fear conquered</h3>
    <p>I was being chased by a man with a bow and arrow, then I realized it was a dream and there was nothing to be afraid of, 
    I turned around and the man was tiny and harmless now. Fear made him large and dangerous, once I 
    overcame my fear, he became harmless.</p>
    
    <h3>Transportation</h3>
    <p>After becoming lucid, I was able to explore some different dream locations. First I was in a Japanese bath house and then I 
    just walked along into other scenes, first to an abandoned greenhouse and garden, then to a huge mansion with suits of armor 
    and a large pool.</p>
